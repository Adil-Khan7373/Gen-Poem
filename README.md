Description of the Project: Romantic Poem Generator
The Romantic Poem Generator is a visually engaging web application that allows users to generate a romantic poem based on a keyword they provide. It incorporates modern web technologies and design elements to create an interactive and captivating user experience. Below is an explanation of the various components and features of the project:

Key Features
Interactive Poem Generation:

Users enter a keyword related to their desired theme (e.g., "Love," "Forever," or a name).
The application sends a request to an AI-based API to generate a romantic, rhyming, 4-line poem based on the input keyword.
Beautiful User Interface:

A calming gradient background with colors resembling a rainy forest.
A sleek and responsive design ensures the application looks good across devices.
Smooth animations and a fixed navigation bar enhance usability and visual appeal.
Particles.js Background Animation:

The Particles.js library creates an animated particle effect in the background, adding depth and dynamism to the webpage.
Typewriter Effect for Displaying Poems:

The generated poem is displayed using a typewriter effect, providing an engaging and dramatic reveal for the user.
Loading Animation:

A blinking text animation informs users that their poem is being generated, enhancing the interaction while the application communicates with the API.
Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3:

For structuring and styling the webpage.
CSS animations and a responsive layout are used for an engaging user experience.
JavaScript:

For handling form submission and making the API call.
Libraries used:
Typewriter Effect: For animated text reveal.
Particles.js: For interactive background effects.
Axios:

A JavaScript library for making HTTP requests to the AI-based poem generation API.
SheCodes AI API:

Used to generate the romantic poem. The prompt and context sent to the API guide the AI to create relevant and personalized poetry.
Responsive Design:

The layout adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile and desktop devices.
How the Project Works
User Interaction:

The user enters a keyword in the input field (e.g., "Love").
When they click the "Generate Poem" button, a request is sent to the API.
Backend Integration:

The app uses the SheCodes AI API to generate a romantic poem based on the keyword.
A prompt is crafted to ensure the poem matches the desired style (romantic, short, rhyming).
Poem Display:

While the poem is being generated, a blinking "in-progress" message is shown.
Once the poem is received, it is displayed with a typewriter effect.
Error Handling:

If something goes wrong (e.g., API fails), a friendly error message is shown to the user.
Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to blend art and technology by:

Providing a personalized and entertaining experience for users who enjoy poetry.
Showcasing modern web design and interaction techniques.
Demonstrating the integration of AI services into web applications.
This project is perfect for those seeking an enjoyable and artistic way to explore poetry creation or for developers showcasing their skills in building interactive AI-driven applications.
